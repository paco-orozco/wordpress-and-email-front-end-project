# Eaze Wordpress and Email Front End Project

> Our Wordpress and Email code challenge for engineering applicants

## Project

The purpose of this exercise is to help the Eaze Engineering team get a feel for your technical skill level. This exercise is split into two parts: the creation of a new page template for a Wordpress theme, and the creation of a responsive HTML email.

### Wordpress Team Page Template

You’ll need to get a WordPress development environment set up on your local machine. Once that’s running, create a page at `/team` that satisfies these requirements:

1. An updatable list of team members with:
	- name
	- title
	- photo
	- description
2. A section for admins to write a short summary of the team at the top of the page

There are no mockups for this one, so don’t worry about making it look great.

### Announcement Email

 Please write an HTML email that matches this mockup:

 Make sure it satisfies these requirements:

 1. renders well on all major email apps/platforms
 2. renders well for various screen sizes
 3. Works without images off

## Setup

Start by cloning this repo. Everything you'll need to get started is already configured for you. You'll need to commit your code at least once, but probably more often. Please use whatever commit and code style you like best.

There are three directories in this repo:

1. `theme/` - the wordpress theme you’ll be adding to
3. `email/announcement.html` - put your email html here
4. `email/images/` - any images you’ll need for this email
