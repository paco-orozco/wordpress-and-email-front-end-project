The email portion of the project is in the announcement.html file

The majority of the Wordpress section is in the wp-content > themes > theme section

I constructed a team section that will add the individual members of team according to a UI form in the WP customization section. This logic is done in the functions.php file. From here the layout is displayed in the template-team.php page that I made. I built this template so that each team member could be added in a simple and intuative manner. I built a styling redirection for the template-team.php page.
